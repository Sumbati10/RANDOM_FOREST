In this notebook, we look at a specific ensemble learning technique, the random forest. This algorithm is the combination of multiple decision trees. We'll examine how we can implement these models in Python using the sklearn library and also how random forests contribute to understanding the importance of predictive variables within a dataset.

Learning Objectives
Understand how random forests differ from decision trees.
Understand the training process of random forests and how we can use them to make predictions.
Know how to build a random forest regression model.
Understand how to use random forests to assess predictive variable importance.
